<< Problem Statement >>

In this project, we develop a machine learning model to predict medical insurance charges based on various personal and health attributes. 
The dataset comprises the following attributes: age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker status, region, and insurance charges. 
Our goal is to create a predictive model that accurately estimates insurance costs based on these factors.

<< Proposed Solution >>

The proposed system aims to address the challenge of predicting medical insurance charges. T
his involves leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques to accurately forecast potential costs. The solution will consist of the following components:

1)Data Collection:
The dataset taken from the Kaggle website.
Collect data with 7 attributes: age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker status, region, and insurance charges.

2)Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the collected data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Cleaning and organizing the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

3)Machine Learning Algorithm:
Algorithm Selection: We use Linear Regression due to its effectiveness in predicting continuous outcomes.
Divide the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split),
Train the Logistic Regression model using the training data and Use the testing data to make predictions.

4)Deployment:
Integration: Implement the model into a user-friendly interface for healthcare use.
Implementing the model for practical use in predicting insurance costs.

5)Evaluation:
Performance Metrics: We Evaluate the R squared value for the both training and testing data.
Assessing the performance of the models.

<< Algorithm & Deployment >>

In the Algorithm section, describe the machine learning algorithm chosen for Medical insurance prediction. Here's an example structure for this section:

Algorithm Selection:
For predicting medical insurance costs, we choose Linear Regression due to its suitability for continuous data prediction. 
This algorithm provides clear interpretability of results, making it ideal for analyzing how various factors affect insurance charges. 
It effectively models the relationship between multiple predictors and the cost of insurance.

Data Input:
The model uses the following input features: age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker status, and region. 
These features were selected based on their relevance to predicting medical insurance costs. 
There are three Categorical Features in this data which are Sex, Smoker, Region.

Training Process:
First, we Visualize every attribute using countplot and histplot.
We change the three Categorical Features (Sex, Smoker, Region) into the numerical data using replace.
Then the dataset is split into training and testing sets, with the training set used to fit the model. 
The algorithm is trained using historical patient data. 

Prediction Process:
Once trained, the Linear Regression model predicts medical insurance costs for new individuals based on their input features. 
Real-time data can be entered into the system, which then outputs a cost estimate, aiding in budgeting and financial planning.

<< Result >>

Present the results of the machine learning model in terms of its accuracy and effectiveness in predicting medical insurance costs using Linear Regression. 
Include visualizations and comparisons between predicted and actual values to highlight the model's performance. 
We used metrics such as R-squared to evaluate the model. 
We change the Categorical Features into the numerical data which are Sex(male(0),female(1)),Smoker(yes(0),no(1)),Region(southeast(0),southwest(1),northeast(2),northwest(3)). 
The model predicts continuous values representing insurance charges. 
When we input new data, it should contain the specified features (age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, region), and the model outputs an estimated insurance cost.
